# HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Prediction
📌 Project: HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The goal is to provide insights into which employees are most likely to leave the company and what factors drive attrition, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions for employee retention.

🔑 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled categorical encoding, feature scaling, and irrelevant column removal.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Attrition distribution (Attrition vs. Non-Attrition).

Department-wise attrition trends.

Key patterns from categorical & numerical features.

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression – Identified top positive/negative drivers of attrition.

Random Forest Classifier – Extracted feature importance for attrition prediction.

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualizations: Bar charts and feature importance plots for better interpretability.
